            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Light painting with pixelstick</h1><p>More info at thepixelstick.com! We spent the last year building pixelstick, a light painting tool capable of everything from photo-real renders to amazing abstract ribbons. We've improved with every iteration and are excited to finally show off what it can do. Everything was shot by just two slightly sleep deprived guys and one Pixelstick in Brooklyn.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/f83450408b8ae969aa617e22dc894484/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F481060213_1280x720.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>City Guide Spotlight: New York City</h1><p>A few days ahead of NYC's hectic and inspiring Armory Week, Scope and Pulse Art Fairs, we embarked upon an overhaul of our NYC City Guide.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>3sixteen + Herman Miller</h1><p>LES-based raw denim fiends 3sixteen advocate skilled craftsmanship and longevity-which is why they often post photos of their customers' faded, worn-in jeans after years of use. Thus, their special collaboration with design manufacturer Herman Miller makes perfect sense, as there's a shared commitment to inspiring through timeless, dependable design.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f04a92fd70ba0596ea6b8079424cfee8970ec89c.jpg"></article>]]></description>
